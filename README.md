# CSS Demos

CSS by example

## Content

The demos cover CSS basics such as:

* Font & text
* Layout of block level elements
* Layout of inline level elements
* Floating
* Positioning

If you look at CSS in detail it can be surprisingly complex. Even if you're an experienced frontend developer, I encourage you to take a look and may be learn something new.

## Motivation

I'm giving lectures at [DHBW Mannheim](http://www.dhbw-mannheim.de). I found that teaching by example yields the best results.

## Status

Currently this is merely a collection of static pages. I'd like to make it more dynamic and include challenges running within the browser.
